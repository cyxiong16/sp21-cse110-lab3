                <p>I woke up a little before 1pm today and felt well rested but also tired from sleeping too much.
                    Then I cooked <b>breakfast/lunch</b>. This is what I ate:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Pork and cabbage bun</li>
                    <li>Water spinach</li>
                    <li>Pig ears</li>
                    <li>Milk</li>
                    <li>Salmon w/ eggs</li>
                    <li>Grapes</li>
                </ul>
                <p>It looks like a lot, but it was only a little bit of each and it was for breakfast and lunch combined
                    so I didn't feel too stuffed afterwards.
                </p>
                <p>I have quite a bit of homework I have to finish over the weekend. This is the order I will complete them in:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>CSE 110 Lab 2</li>
                    <li>MGT 181 Problem Set 1</li>

                <p>Yesterday, three of my friends and I drove to CVS to get our <strong>COVID-19</strong> vaccines. Here's an image of
                    the card:

                    Toby is a <span>Cavalier and Poodle</span> mix. He's a little over 6 months old right now.
                    His birthday is October 6, 2020. He was tiny when we got him (around 6 lbs), and now he's almost
                    10 lbs!
